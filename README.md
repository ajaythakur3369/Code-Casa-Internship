- **Movie Recommendation System -** Developed a **Movie Recommendation System** that **Recommends** movies to users based on their **Past Viewing History** and **Ratings** using **PorterStemmer** and **CountVectorizer** techniques with the help of **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **NLTK**, and others.
